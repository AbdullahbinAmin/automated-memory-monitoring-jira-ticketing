User is working on a mini project related to automated memory monitoring and ticket creation, and plans to push it on GitHub.Hereâ€™s a refined version of the project, combining memory monitoring, JIRA ticket creation, and email notifications. I've also added real-life issue case details in the JIRA ticket creation section and integrated the email sending functionality into the process. This should be easy to follow for anyone looking to implement a similar solution. Here's the code:

# Automated Memory Monitoring and Ticket Creation with JIRA and Email Notification
## Objective:
This project automates the monitoring of server memory on a Linux machine and creates JIRA tickets when memory is low. It also sends an email to the reporter of the ticket, asking for manager approval before proceeding further.
________________________________________
## Project Structure:
### 1.	Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: paramiko, jira, smtplib, email.mime.multipart
- JIRA API access: You need a JIRA API key and authentication details.
- SSH access to the Linux server.

### 2.	Dependencies Installation: 

Run the following command to install required Python libraries:

``` bash
pip install paramiko jira
```

### 3.	GitHub Repository Setup: 

Create a new repository on GitHub and push the code there for easy access and version control.

## Code Implementation:

``` python

import smtplib
import paramiko
from jira import JIRA
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart


# Server and SSH credentials
hostname = "YOUR SERVER IP ADDRESS"
username = "YOUR USERNAME"
password = "YOUR PASSWORD"

# JIRA User credentials and API Key
user = "YOUR JIRA ACCOUNT EMAIL"
api_key = 'YOUR JIRA ACCOUNT API KEY'

# JIRA Server URL
server = "YOUR JIRA ATLASSIAN WEBSITE LINK"

# Connect to JIRA
jira = JIRA(server=server, basic_auth=(user, api_key))

# SSH Client Setup
client = paramiko.SSHClient()
client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
client.connect(hostname=hostname, username=username, password=password)

# Command to check available memory
cmd = "free -g"
std_in, std_out, std_error = client.exec_command(cmd)

# Output of the command
cmdout = std_out.readlines()
for i in cmdout:
    print(i)

# Extract available memory from the command output
available_memory = cmdout[1].split()[6]

# Check if the available memory is less than or equal to 1GB
if int(available_memory) <= 1:
    print(f"Alert: Available memory on server {hostname} is critically low ({available_memory}GB).")

    # Prepare the issue details
    Summary = f"Memory Available: {available_memory}GB"
    Description = f"""Dear Team,

    A memory shortage has been detected on the server {hostname}.
    Available memory: {available_memory}GB.

    This is a critical issue that requires your immediate attention.
    Please review and take appropriate action to resolve the memory shortage.

    Thank you,

## Explanation of Code:

### 1.	SSH Connection to the Server:
- The paramiko library is used to connect to a remote Linux server and execute the free -g command to check available memory.

### 2.	JIRA Integration:
- The script uses the jira library to create a JIRA ticket when the available memory is below 1GB. The ticket includes a description of the issue and is assigned to the relevant stakeholder.

### 3.	Email Notification:
- When a ticket is created, an email is sent to the reporter requesting approval from their manager to proceed further with the ticket. The email includes the ticket details and instructions for the approval process.

### 4.	Real-Life Scenario for the Issue:
- In the real-world scenario, when the server's memory falls below a critical threshold, it may affect the performance and stability of applications hosted on the server. A quick resolution is necessary to avoid downtime. The ticket created highlights this issue and ensures it is handled promptly.

## How to Run the Project:

### 1.	Install Dependencies: 
Make sure to install the required libraries (paramiko, jira, smtplib).

### 2.	JIRA Setup:
- Create a JIRA project if you don't already have one (in this case, IIP).
- Generate an API key for authentication.

### 3.	Email Setup:
Configure the email address and app-specific password for the email account used to send notifications.

### 4.	Run the Script:
Once everything is set up, you can run the Python script to monitor the server's memory. The script will check the available memory and create a JIRA ticket if necessary.

### 5.	GitHub:
Push the entire project to GitHub for version control and sharing.

## Final Thoughts:
This project demonstrates the power of automation in IT support. By integrating server monitoring, issue tracking (via JIRA), and email notifications, the script provides a streamlined process for addressing critical memory issues and ensures that the required stakeholders are notified promptly. It is highly customizable for different IT environments and can be adapted to handle other types of system monitoring.
